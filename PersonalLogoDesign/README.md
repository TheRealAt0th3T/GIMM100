# The Design Process
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started my design process by brainstorming ideas for what I could incorporate my
initial, AT, into. I also wanted to keep in mind what this logo would be used for, as the logo’s
usage would also determine what kind of design I would be after. I started off with the idea of an
outdoorsy concept, such as making a logo as if I ran a ski mountain or camping grounds. I then
started to play with the idea of creating a logo for signing artwork or also something that would
be fun to graffiti onto a wall of a tattoo shop. I played with the idea of turning my initials into a
smiley face. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first few versions were not great. They were too perfect and clean. I didn’t like the
structured feeling that they gave off. Some people would like them more as they included
perfect circles and curvy designs. My art style tends to be more aggressive and intense, same
with the usual signatures I use for art. I wanted an aesthetic and feeling to the logo that fit more
to my style. I then started to work on designs that fit more to the style that the quick sketch was. <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of trying to make perfect circles, I went for a quick, seemingly effortless ellipse. I
also redesigned the brush I was using. I originally went after a more acrylic paint look, but I
switched it up to more of a dry brush. I also decided to keep the edginess of the letter A instead
of trying to turn it into a more curvy letter. I like how the letter T sideways made it look like a
winky face, adding a playful touch to the design. I also wanted to play with the three primary
colours, yellow, red, and blue, and thus I decided to incorporate a tongue sticking out. This not
only helped add red, but it also emphasized the kind of goofiness I wanted my logo to
encompass. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end, I do like my logo. I do think I will be using it for future signatures on artwork. I
do know that there can be a lot of critiques on it though. The logo is imperfect, with the not fully
closed ellipse. You can see through all the colours due to the brush stroke style I used to fill in
the colour, but I think it fits me and my personality. I really do see this, or at least a future
updated version of this, being something I paint on my walls and use as my logo on artwork,
t-shirts, and other merch. <br>
